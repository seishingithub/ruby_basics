=begin
Write a program that prints out verses of "99 bottles of beer
on the wall", according to the following rules:

* The user must type "sing 88", where 88 is
any positive number
* If the user runs the program without typing
anything, print "I need to know how many bottles to sing!"
* If the user runs the program and specifies a verse
with "sing <number>", print all the lines from the song
starting at that verse
* If the user types anything but "sing <number>", show an
error and exit
